# Hate-speech-detection-in-Social-Media-using-python

## Description of the project
In this project, I begin by addressing the issue of freedom of speech on the Internet and the misuse of social media platforms like Twitter. These challenges serve as my primary motivation.
To achieve my goals, I utilize a publicly available dataset from CrowdFlower and apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques. I outline the workflow, starting with dataset analysis and followed by text preprocessing to create a cleaner dataset. This cleaned dataset is then used for feature engineering.
I extract unique and significant features, organizing them into different sets for comparison. I analyze the performance of various machine learning classification algorithms concerning each feature set.
Finally, I delve into a detailed analysis of the results obtained, explaining the reasons behind misclassifications in my model.
